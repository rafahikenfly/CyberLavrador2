Sumé é a linguagem de programação de rotinas do robô jardineiro Cyberlavrador

Abaixo estão descritas as tags permitidas em Sumé:
<Xmax> - posição X máxima do objeto alvo da tarefa
<Xmin> - posição X mínima do objeto alvo da tarefa
<Ymax> - posição Y máxima do objeto alvo da tarefa
<Ymin> - posição Y mínima do objeto alvo da tarefa
<Zmax> - posição Z máxima do objeto alvo da tarefa
<Zmin> - posição Z mínima do objeto alvo da tarefa
LOOP x y - retorna para a linha x do código, repetindo y vezes

GCodes (GRBL 1.1)
F Set Feed rate in Units/min (See G20/G21).
G0 A Rapid positioning move at the Rapid Feed Rate. In Laser mode Laser will be turned off.
G1 A Cutting move in a straight line. At the Current F rate.
G2 Cut a Clockwise arc.
G3 Cut an Anti-Clockwise arc.
G4 Pause command execution for the time in Pnnn. P specifies the time in seconds. Other systems use milliseconds as the pause time, if used unchanged this can result in VERY long pauses.
G10L2 Sets the offset for a saved origin using absolute machine coordinates.
G10L20 As G10 L2 but the XYZ parameters are offsets from the current position.
G17 Draw Arcs in the XY plane, default.
G18 Draw Arcs in the ZX plane.
G19 Draw Arcs in the YZ plane.
G20 All distances and positions are in Inches
G21 All distances and positions are in mm
G28 Go to safe position. NOTE: If you have not run a homing cycle and have set the safe position this is very ‘unsafe’ to use.
G28.1 Set Safe position using absolute machine coordinates.
G30 Go to the saved G30 position.
G30.1 Set Predefined position using absolute machine coordinates, a rapid G0 move to that position will be performed before the coordinates are saved.
G38.2 Probe towards the stock, error on a failure
G38.3 As G38.2, no error on failure
G38.4 As G38.2 but move away, stop on a loss of contact.
G38.5 As G38.4, no error on failure.
G40 Cutter Compensation off. Grbl does not support cutter compensation.
G43.1 Dynamic Tool length offset, offsets Z end of tool position for subsequent moves.
G49 Cancel Tool length Offset.
G53 Use machine coordinates in this command.
G54 Activate the relevant saved origin.
G55-59 As G54, activates a different saved position
G61 Exact Path mode. Grbl does not support any other modes.
G80 Canned Cycle Cancel. Grbl does not support any of the canned cycle modes which this cancels so it does nothing.
G90 All distances and positions are Absolute values from the current origin.
G91 All distances and positions are Relative values from the current position.
G91.1 Sets Arc incremental position mode
G92 Sets the current coordinate point, used to set an origin point of zero, commonly known as the home position.
G92.1 Reset any G92 offsets in effect to zero and zero any saved values
G93 Inverse time motion mode.
G94 Units/min mode at the current F rate.
